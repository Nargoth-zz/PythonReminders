# Python Classes 
 
Short example of a python class. Beware that there is a diffence between *new-style* classes inheriting from
*object* and *old-style* classes without inheritance. One should always use *new-style* classes, emerging from
the inheritance of other *new-style* classes or, in case this is not needed, from the inheritance of *object*.
